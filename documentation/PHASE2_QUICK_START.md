### Option 3: Python Script

```python
from src.auth.gmail_oauth import GmailAuthenticator
from src.email_analysis.fetcher import EmailFetcher
from src.email_analysis.signal_extractor import SignalExtractor
from src.utils.config import load_config

# Load config and authenticate
config = load_config()
auth = GmailAuthenticator(config)
creds = auth.load_credentials()

# Fetch emails
fetcher = EmailFetcher(creds)
emails = fetcher.fetch_recent_emails(max_results=100)
sent_emails = fetcher.fetch_sent_emails(max_results=50)
user_email = fetcher.get_user_email()

# Extract signals
extractor = SignalExtractor()
signals = extractor.extract_all_signals(emails, sent_emails, user_email)

# Access results
print(f"Newsletters: {signals.newsletter_signals.total_newsletters}")
print(f"Industry: {signals.professional_context.inferred_industry}")
print(f"Formality: {signals.communication_style.formality_score}")
print(f"Emails/day: {signals.activity_patterns.emails_per_day}")
```

## Understanding Results

### Newsletter Signals
- **Total found**: Number of newsletters detected
- **Percentage**: What % of your inbox is newsletters
- **Categories**: Topics you follow (tech, finance, etc.)
- **Top newsletters**: Your most frequent subscriptions

### Communication Style
- **Email length**: Average words per email
- **Formality**: 0-1 score (0=casual, 1=formal)
  - 0.0-0.3: Very casual (Hey! What's up?)
  - 0.4-0.6: Moderately formal (Hi, thanks...)
  - 0.7-1.0: Very formal (Dear Sir, Sincerely...)
- **Emoji usage**: % of emails with emojis
- **Greetings/signoffs**: Your common patterns

### Professional Context
- **Industry**: Best guess based on contact domains
- **Contact domains**: Companies you email with
- **Affiliations**: Likely employers/clients
- **Keywords**: Common professional terms

### Activity Patterns
- **Emails/day**: Average daily email volume
- **Peak hours**: When you're most active (0-23)
- **Peak days**: Most active days of week
- **Response rate**: % of emails that are replies
- **Thread depth**: Average conversation length

## Saved Data

All signals are automatically saved to:
```
reports/signals_{your_email}_{timestamp}.json
```

This JSON file contains the complete analysis and can be:
- Imported into other tools
- Used for Phase 3 (Identity Resolution)
- Analyzed programmatically
- Shared (remove sensitive data first!)

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Check Newsletter Overload
```python
if signals.newsletter_signals.newsletter_percentage > 50:
    print("Warning: Over half your inbox is newsletters!")
    print("Top offenders:", signals.newsletter_signals.top_newsletters[:5])
```

### 2. Analyze Communication Style
```python
formality = signals.communication_style.formality_score
if formality > 0.7:
    print("Your emails are very formal")
elif formality < 0.4:
    print("Your emails are quite casual")
else:
    print("Your emails strike a good balance")
```

### 3. Identify Your Industry
```python
industry = signals.professional_context.inferred_industry
if industry:
    print(f"You appear to work in: {industry}")
    print(f"With companies: {signals.professional_context.company_affiliations}")
```

### 4. Optimize Email Timing
```python
peak_hours = signals.activity_patterns.peak_activity_hours
print(f"You're most active at: {peak_hours}")
print("Consider scheduling important emails during these times!")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No newsletters found"
**Normal if**:
- You don't subscribe to newsletters
- Your account is mostly personal emails

**Action**: None needed, this is expected behavior

### Issue: "Industry: None"
**Normal if**:
- You mainly use personal email (Gmail, Yahoo)
- Your contacts are mostly individuals

**Action**: Use a work email for better results

### Issue: Low quality score (<0.5)
**Causes**:
- Not enough emails (<50 total)
- Mostly one-off emails (few threads)
- Recent account with little history

**Fix**: Increase `max_results` when fetching:
```python
emails = fetcher.fetch_recent_emails(max_results=500)
sent_emails = fetcher.fetch_sent_emails(max_results=200)
```

### Issue: Formality score seems wrong
**Note**: Formality scoring from metadata is approximate

**For better results** (future):
- Phase 2.5 will analyze full email bodies
- More accurate scoring with complete text

## Next Steps

### Improve Signal Quality
1. **Fetch more emails**: Increase from 100 to 500+
2. **Use work email**: Better professional signals
3. **Include older emails**: Better activity patterns

### Move to Phase 3
Once you're happy with signal extraction:
```bash
# Phase 3: Identity Resolution
# - Extract your name from emails
# - Search for LinkedIn/Twitter profiles
# - AI-powered match confidence scoring
```

### Customize Analysis
```python
# Create custom analysis
def analyze_newsletter_addiction(signals):
    nl_pct = signals.newsletter_signals.newsletter_percentage
    if nl_pct > 60:
        return "🚨 Newsletter Overload! Time to unsubscribe!"
    elif nl_pct > 40:
        return "⚠️ Heavy newsletter user"
    elif nl_pct > 20:
        return "✅ Healthy newsletter balance"
    else:
        return "📭 Minimal newsletters"

result = analyze_newsletter_addiction(signals)
print(result)
```

## Performance Tips

### Faster Analysis
- Use metadata format (already default)
- Limit email fetching if testing: `max_results=50`
- Signal extraction is already fast (<1s for 100 emails)

### Better Results
- Fetch 500+ emails for comprehensive analysis
- Include both personal and work accounts
- Wait until account has 3+ months of history

### API Rate Limits
- Gmail API: 1 billion quota units/day (free tier)
- Phase 2: ~5 units per email
- Can analyze 200 million emails/day for free 🎉
